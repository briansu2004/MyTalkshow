### Costco

<https://youtu.be/JS3Vw5oUusI>

As a mid-age family man who lives in Canada, Costco is a place you can't miss.

Especially when COVID started a few years ago, you want to reduce your unnecessary outdoor activities, you gonna go to Costco to have a one-stop-for-all shop for one or more weeks - at least I keep doing that. Every time when I cleared my shopping cart, sometimes there are 2 carts, I pay more than $1000 dollars. The highest was $1500.

But they are all just routine regular things. It was funny that one day, both the cashier, and the guard on the exit, asked me how often I do such purchases, and how many people I paid for. Initially I thought they were joking about a mid-age guy, but I realized something when I left the Costco parking lot - oh my god, they suspected that I was doing a group buy for buyers in China. Hey it was not funny. I know there are a few men and women did these in Richmond Hill. They don't have other jobs, they just enter Costco every morning in the opening time, they used their iPhones to do live streaming to many people, they talked loud unscrupulously, something like this: 还有没有人要啊 还有下单的吗 This is not funny at all.

Speaking of the Costco guards, in the busy time there will be 2, and each of them served a very long line. Costco said their jobs are helping customers to not get over-charged. What? Are you kidding? And there is another thing. I did a lot of Costco car services. They asked me to park the car in the lot then go in through the entrance. So I need to take my bag out from my car, then go in to hand in my car key to them. And then I need to carry my bag out of Costco before the car service to be finished. Here is the problem - before the exit, the guards will ask me to open my bag and show them. mmm - I guess they don't want me to get over-paid, right?

But all of these things are not problems. I am fine for them. However, I do NOT understand one thing. It bothers me a lot. It happened many times and I don't get why.

Let me explain - I believe nobody wants to waste time on lining up. Have you heard the Murphy's laws. Ok, one of them is - whichever line you chose to line up, it would be the slowest. Does it ring the bell? I am a busy man so I really want to take the shortest time when I line up. You know there is no express checkout in Costco ... So one day I found at my favorite Richmond Hill Costco, some lines only have 1 cashier, but the other lines they have special assistant ladies. I call them assistant ladies because they are always female, they took your items from your buggy (hi I don't know why they called it in such a weird name), then put on the conveyor belt, and did the reverse things after the cashier scanned all of them. I feel that this will speed up the checkout process, right? So I always tried to line up at such lines, even it looked longer than the regular lines who don't have assistant ladies. But wait. Things are never easy like that.

Let me tell you what I ended up with. Every single time when I chose the line that has an assistant lady, I watched her to do her job well to every customer in front of me. Finally, it was my turn, then the magic started. She walked away. She just left and then the line became a normal line again. This happened every single time - total about 10 times already. Sometimes the assistant lady saw me, but other times she didn't even give me a look at all. She just left my alone.

Why? This is not scientific. It doesn't apply the probability rules. If you toss a coin, there is 50% probability to be head, and 50% probability to be tail, right?

Where is the problem? I even tried to take off my hat and expose my grey hair. I am not bald but I got grey hair since I was a teenager. But this card never helped. I've solved a lot of math problems since I had grey hair, but I can't solve this problem.
